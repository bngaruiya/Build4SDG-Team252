# Build for SDG - TEAM 252 Project
The team is building a crop disease classification application. The application uses a resnet-152 to classify 15 different crop disease categories based on images obtained from the plant village Dataset.
The classifier can be found at [Crop Disease Classifier Repo](https://github.com/bngaruiya/CropDiseaseClassifier).
